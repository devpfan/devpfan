- 👋 Hi, I’m @devpfan
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Java development and software engineering. I love diving into complex problems and crafting elegant solutions through code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various Java frameworks and technologies, such as Spring Boot and Hibernate, to enhance my skill set and create more robust applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Java projects (or any Java projects) where I can contribute my skills and learn from experienced developers in the community.
- 📫 Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (pafamaga) or shoot me an email at pfabian@outlook.com. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and discuss ideas!
